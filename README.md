# React-BlogTutorial

This was the first React tutorial I followed from the Youtuber [TheNetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d).

In this tutorial you follow all the basics of React of which I am going to use in my next project where I will put the skills I learnt to the test.
